# Welcome
A set of small projects I am creating using python.

# Projects
## Bagels
In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.

## Birthday Paradox
The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance of two people having a matching birthday. But even in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent chance of a matching birthday. This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experiments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.

You can find out more about the Birthday Paradox at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem.

## Bitmap Message
This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message from the user. In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, and all other characters are replaced by characters in the user’s message. The provided bitmap resembles a world map, but you can change this to any image you’d like. The binary simplicity of the space-or-message-characters system makes it good for beginners. Try experimenting with different messages to see what the results look like!
